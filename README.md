# Mercado-UI

The Web-UI for the [Mercado-Server](https://github.com/HaosGames/mercado) API

## Run Webserver

To run the webserver you need to setup your rust toolchain
like it is descibed in this guide: https://book.leptos.dev/getting_started/index.html.

```bash
$ trunk serve
```

Currently it connects to the server api at 127.0.0.1:8081 by default.
